  <h3>Helping make organisations and their people open and transparent. Finding new ways to share the right messages, in the right place, at the right time.</h3>

</div>

With 10 years of communications and editorial experience, I’ve worked for high-profile organisations with hundreds of years of history to share as well as brand new digital teams creating their own stories. I’m currently Content Lead for the UK Parliament, maintaining a balance between hands-on content design, communications consultancy, and directing a team.
