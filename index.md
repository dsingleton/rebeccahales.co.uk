### Helping organisations and their people to be open and transparent about their work. Finding new ways to share the right messages, in the right place, at the right time.

Fleet Street. Whitehall. Westminster. With 10 years’ communications and editorial experience, I’ve worked for high-profile organisations with centuries of history to share, as well as world-class digital teams creating their own brand new stories.

I’m currently Head of Content Design and Digital Engagement for the UK Parliament. There I maintain a balance between hands-on content design, strategic comms consultancy, and leading teams of people who believe it’s important that everyone can access and understand what’s going on in Parliament.
