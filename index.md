### Helping make organisations and their people open and transparent. Finding new ways to share the right messages, in the right place, at the right time.

With 10 years of communications and editorial experience, I’ve worked for high-profile organisations with hundreds of years of history to share as well as brand new digital teams creating their own stories.

I’m currently Content Lead for the UK Parliament, maintaining a balance between hands-on content design, communications consultancy, and directing a team.
