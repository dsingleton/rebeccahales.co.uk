### Helping organisations and their people to be open and transparent about their work. Finding new ways to share the right messages, in the right place, at the right time.

Fleet Street. Whitehall. Westminster. With 10 years’ communications and editorial experience, I’ve worked for high-profile organisations with centuries of history to share, as well as world-class digital teams creating their own brand new stories.

I'm currently Head of Content Design and SEO for BT, EE, and Plusnet. Since August 2019, I've set up, grown, and am continuing to develop one of the UK's largest private sector content design teams and establishing new user-centred ways of working across three brilliant brands. I provide design leadership and set the strategic direction of almost 100 designers, editors and SEO experts serving more than 34 million customers.

Previously I was Head of Content Design and Digital Engagement for the UK Parliament. There I maintained a balance between hands-on content design, strategic comms consultancy, and led teams of people who believed it’s important that everyone can access and understand what’s going on in Parliament.
